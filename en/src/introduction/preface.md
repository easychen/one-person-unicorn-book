# Preface

![](../image/sob1.jpeg)

First, let's be clear: this book does not describe the present, but **a future that is highly likely to happen**.

I must admit, this goes against my usual cautious style.

Readers familiar with *Lean Side Hustle* and *One-Person Business Methodology* know that my past writing was based on experience, practice, and repeated verification, striving to be error-free. But this book is extremely special—it is built in a wilderness with no precedents, relying purely on underlying assumptions and rigorous logical deduction. In this way, errors are inevitable. Therefore, please be sure to read this book with critical thinking.

The reason for adopting this "risky" strategy is that the iteration speed of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) era has long since shattered the traditional linear logic of "observe-verify-summarize".

In this field, when a business paradigm is fully verified by the public, the bonus often disappears due to the rapid decline in marginal costs. Waiting for others' success stories is like arriving at the scene with a shovel only after the gold mine has been exhausted. Therefore, we must use a forward-looking gaze to explore that emerging new continent.

This book is built on a core assumption:

> **Agents will possess the competency of mid-to-senior level employees and can independently handle most business tasks.**

This is already a determined finale; the only variable is time—whether it's one year, two years, or three years. This critical point will not strike globally in sync like the New Year's bell, but will arrive unevenly across different industries and scenarios. Taking the fastest-evolving programming field as an example, top-tier models can now independently complete the vast majority of routine development. And the singularity for other industries will inevitably arrive one after another.

This book will complete the theoretical top-level design first, and immediately switch to commercial combat when the technology matures. In fact, even now in 2026, we can already see the embryonic form of fully automated business loops in certain specific scenarios.

Of course, if you insist on not believing this assumption, you might as well treat this book as a piece of science fiction about future work.

Now, let us begin with a startling prophecy.
